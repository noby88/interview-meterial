/** What is "this" keyword in JS
 * The “this” keyword refers to the object that the function is a property of.
 * The value of “this” keyword will always depend on the object that is invoking the function.

/** What is a pure function
 * Pure Function is a function (a block of code ) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed.
 * It does not depend on any state, or data change during a program’s execution rather it only depends on its input arguments.
 * Also a pure function does not produce any observable side effects such as network requests or data mutation etc.
